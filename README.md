# ChessEngine-JavaFX

You will need the chess piece images for the board and for the cursor, you can get them here; http://www.filedropper.com/chessimagesnew

Object orientated event driven model, probably a lot of inefficient bits and pieces so feel free to make some pull requests

Feel free to use this if you want but please credit me/email me to let me know

Notes:

You'll need to let JavaFX be accessible in the build path, in your project's properties/preferences select "Build Path".

Then select the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) and add the access rule 'javafx/**'
